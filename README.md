- 👋 Hi, I’m @SoggyWaffle27
- 👀 Eye'm interested in terrible jokes that will either make you happy or worsen your day. For example, "people are usually shocked when they find out that I'm a terrible electrician"
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Code I guess
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on absolutly nothing. Im scared of group work
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Its more likely that you will die while going to buy a lottery ticket than to actually win.
